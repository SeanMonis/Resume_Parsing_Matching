after I told u I have things to tell you, you asked me twice n let it be. I was sad that you were not curious to know what I had to tell. after u asked me the second time, I told u ,I wont tell u because u didn't open my chats today ig u could wait until tm to know.
I hinted at u that I was lil sad tht u hadn't opened my chats on this phone so tht atleast after knowing tht u would ask again or smthin but u said " if u insist" which felt like u dnt care to know n neither were u sorry for it. n upon tht u said gn child which hurt me more.
when I finished my work that day we were texting on your other phn n then only when I told u that ill send my work on ur other phn is when u opened my chat.n that day since we were texting on that phone , thts y I had continued to text u in tht phone. n I felt like u dnt go to open my chat even when ive not done anything to u. cause u usually dont open my chats when ur upset over me. I felt like u dont care abt me or what I have to tell u. n cried n slept . even I stayed on Instagram sending reels to u thinking u might ask me what it was but u also kept sending reels n didn't want to know. 
n tht day when I asked u if u have anything to talk abt , u said we meet everyday so theres ntg new. 
which made me feel bad , because we dont get to talk a lot , we do stuff n I go .

Saturday I woke up n I knew I cnt meet u, but maybe church. 
I dint text u gm I wanted to see if u would text me if I didn't . n then u texted hi. I wanted u to be interested in me / interested in talking to me. the hi felt like the bare so I let it be n wanted to see if u really cared to talk if I didn't show intrest.

I was feeling low since fri night. actually thurs ngt n thts y I came to see u on fri .

n the day went on , I wanted to text u the way u text me n how u make me wait for ur msg. I wanted u to feel how I feel everytime u do that to me. I would've stopped if at once u asked what happened . but u were so casual n u texted as if it didn't bother u at all . so I felt even bad n let it go on. I thought at ngt u would ask what happened. but even ngt u didn't care to ask me. I felt really bad.

then I thought that even Thursday Friday I was the one who used to text first n kind of realised that u dnt have intrest to talk/nor u cared to knw anythin in what I had to say. 

I just felt bad tht u were not curious to know / interested to know when I told u I hv things to tell n even after I hinted tht u didn't open my chat.n u didn't say anything nor u were sorry but went on to say something tht made me feel like I can never make u feel the way u make me feel bad abt things. n ig that's y when I woke up morning on sat I felt like u got to know how I feel .
